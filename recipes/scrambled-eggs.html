<h3>How to make it!</h3>
<p>The secret to making scrambled eggs is all about patience...and the proper pan. Here's a quick step-by-step guide to show you how to make scrambled eggs,
     plus we'll answer your most frequently asked questions.</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
        <li><strong>Get the  ingredients</strong></li> 
        <p>To make scrambled eggs for two, you'll need 4 to 6 eggs, 4 to 6 tablespoons of milk (figure 1 tablespoon of milk for every egg), 
            and salt and pepper to taste.
             Chopped fresh parsley and other herbs add flavor and visual appeal, but they're completely optional.</p>
       
             <li><strong>Break some eggs</strong></li>
        <p>Crack eggs on a flat surface (helps ensure shells stay out of the mix) into a bowl that's deep enough for some serious whisking.</p>
        
        <li><strong>Add liquid (optional):</strong></li>
        <p> You can thin the scrambled egg mix with milk, cream, lemon juice, or even a little water.</p>
            
        <li><strong>Heat the skillet</strong></li>
        <p>To make scrambled eggs on the stove, melt a teaspoon of butter or olive oil — or a combination of both —</p>
        
        <li><strong>Add the eggs and stir</strong></li>
        <p>When the butter starts to bubble, or a drop of water added to the pan sizzles, slowly pour in the egg mixture. Immediately 
            reduce the heat to medium-low and as soon as the eggs begin to "set"</p>
        
        <li><strong>Add more flavor</strong></li>
        <p>add minced herbs, shredded cheese, crumbled bacon, chopped scallions, 
            sautéed mushrooms, chopped tomato, or anything else you like.</p>
       
        <li><strong>The big finish</strong></li>
        <p>Remove the pan from the heat and continue to stir until the eggs finish cooking using only the residual heat from the pan. This helps prevent the eggs from overcooking</p>
